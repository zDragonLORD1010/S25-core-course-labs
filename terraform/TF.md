# Terraform Lab Report

After installing and updating `docker` and `terraform` to continue working on the task, I obtained `terraform` project data. However, some data could not be received due to an Error: "configuring Terraform AWS Provider: no valid credential sources for Terraform AWS Provider found." I used different proxies and VPNs, used different operating systems, and rewrote the code to fix this error, but I still couldn't continue working. After some stage described in the attached guide, the terraform apply command stopped working. Therefore, I have attached all the files that I could make in this lab in the terraform folder.

*I removed the from `terraform.tfvars` token because github forbade uploading data without protection to the server, and also deleted the folders `.terraform` because they took up a lot of space and git didn't want to accept them.*

## Installation and setup

1. **Install `terraform`**:
   - Download `terraform` from the official website.
   - Add `terraform` to system PATH.
   - Verify installation using:
     ```
     terraform --version
     ```

2. **Install `docker`**:
   - Download `pip` from the official website.
   - Adde `pip` to system PATH.
   - Download `docker` using:
     ```
     pip install docker
     ```

3. **Initialize `terraform` project**:
   - Created a `terraform` directory.
   - Run command to initialize the project and install required providers:
     ```
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

### `terraform state show`
```
Usage: terraform [global options] state show [options] ADDRESS

  Shows the attributes of a resource in the Terraform state.

  This command shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform
  state. The address argument must be used to specify a single resource.
  You can view the list of available resources with "terraform state list".

Options:

  -state=statefile    Path to a Terraform state file to use to look
                      up Terraform-managed resources. By default it will
                      use the state "terraform.tfstate" if it exists.
```

### `terraform state list`
```
docker_container.nginx
docker_image.nginx
```

# Terraform for GitHub

### GitHub Infrastructure Details

Terraform configuration includes:
- Repository name: `core-course-labs`
- Repository description: `Repository for terraform lab`
- Visibility: `public`
- Default branch: `main`
- Branch protection rules applied to `main`

### Import Existing Repository
```
terraform import "github_repository.core-course-labs" "core-course-labs"
```

# Best Practices Implemented

- **State Management**: Used Terraform state to track resources.
- **Environment Variables**: GitHub token stored in `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable instead of hardcoding.
- **Modularization**: Used separate `.tf` files for better organization.
- **Version Locking**: Defined provider versions to ensure stability.
- **Security**: Applied branch protection rules to enforce repository policies.
